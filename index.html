	<h2 class="heading">ABOUT ME</h2>
	<p>I am passionate about teaching young minds, to inspire them and guide them towards excellence. With this course I want to ignite their curiosity and show them the way towards technological superiority through Mathematics, Physics, and Computer programming. I believe there is a lack in the traditional board system of education that only aspire towards higher grades. While better grades are important to make a better curriculum vitae, and thus a better career, some aspire towards ambitions higher that just grades. The traditional boards update their curriculum much slower than the mainstream advancement of science and technology. I wish to nurture these young minds towards a higher understanding of the subjects from a fundamental and conceptual point of view. Thus becoming familiar with the scientific method at a younger age, brings perspective and wisdom at an earlier stage in life when the mind is more receptive and has a higher potential for learning.</p>

	<h2 class="heading">ADVERTISEMENT</h2>
	Extracurricular, but relevent to curriculum.<br><br>

	Programming more important that schools and boards realize.<br><br>

	Big gap between school and university.<br><br>

	Scientific method. Introduction to research principles.<br><br>

	Not reinventing the wheel. New and improved wheel.<br><br>

	Easily become proficient in the current best programming language (Python) and other technologies.<br><br>

	Expand your mind to new possibilities.<br><br>

	Bring creativity into learning process.<br><br>

	Making learning fun!<br><br>

	This is not a programming course! It uses programming as a tool to learn other things,
	and like any tool we have to first learn how to use it for our advantage.
