	<h2 class="heading">What is EpySTEM Project?</h2>
	<p>
		EpySTEM Project is a set of courses that will teach you Python programming for your needs from the very basics.
		Presently, there are beginner courses for (1) high school students, classes 6 to 12, who are aspiring to be engineers and
		scientific researchers, and (2) Biological researchers who want to learn Python programming to augment their research,
		or need mentorship or consultation on their own research projects.
	</p>
	
	<h2 class="heading">MODE OF INSTRUCTION</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Online session once a week: Presentation and demonstration, live coding, example problem solving.</li>
			<li>I will provide detailed pdf documents and jupyter notebooks for you to follow.</li>
			<li>Material will contain many examples to learn from, and exercises to practice.</li>
			<li>The student will take the time to read the material and practice the examples and exercises.</li>
			<li>Student's doubts and questions will be addressed over instant messaging or email.</li>
			<li>Occassionally I will send articles and blogs relevant to all STEM fields and general knowledge for light reading.</li>
			
		</ul>

	<h2 class="heading">ABOUT ME</h2>
	<img src="profile.jpg" align="right" style="width:25vw;min-width:150px;padding:1vw">
	<p>I am a scientific researcher and educator. I am passionate about teaching young minds, and to inspire them and guide them towards excellence. With this course I want to ignite their curiosity and show them the way towards technological superiority through Mathematics, Physics, and Computer programming.  I wish to nurture these young minds towards a higher understanding of the subjects from a fundamental and conceptual point of view. Thus becoming familiar with the scientific method at a younger age, brings perspective and wisdom at an earlier stage in life when the mind is more receptive and has a higher potential for learning.</p>

	<h2 class="heading">INTRODUCTION TO THE COURSE</h2>
	
		<ul>
			<li>The invention and evolution of computers began more than a century ago.</li>
			<li>Physicists invented the computer using Physics to solve Physics problems.</li>
			<li>Initially computers cost millions of dollars, and existed in few research institutes and universities.</li>
			<li>Early computers were very difficult to use and program.</li>
			<li>Over time, Mathematicians invented better and simpler languages to make programming computers easy for everybody.</li>
			<li>Thus Physics, Mathematics, and computer technology are inherently tied together.</li>
			<li>Countless inventions and discoveries and technological advancements have been made possible by computers.</li>
			<li>Now the computer is ubiquitous, everybody has one, and programming languages are much simpler.</li>
			<li>Computers make our lives easier and there is large untapped potential.</li>
